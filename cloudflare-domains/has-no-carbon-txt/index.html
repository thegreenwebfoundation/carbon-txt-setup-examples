<h1>This site has no carbon.txt file served from it</h1>

<p>As the title suggests, this domain should not have a carbon.txt file served from it, nor do any delegation of serving the file to another domain.</p>
<p>This file is being served from the cloudflare CDN, and on this domain <em>any path will serve this page</em>. This means that even visiting <a href="/carbon.txt">/carbon.txt/</a> will serve a 200 OK error in tests.</p>


<h3>Why is this here?</h3>

<p>Rather than relying on a random domain to check when debugging or testing the behaviour of any carbon.txt validators/checkers, this domain exists to provide a known domain that should never have a carbon.txt file served from it.</p>
