<h1>This site has no carbon.txt file served from it</h1>

<p>As the title suggests, this domain should not have a carbon.txt file served from it, nor  do any delegation of serving the file to another domain.</p>

<h3>Why is this here?</h3>

<p>Rather than relying on a random domain to check when debugging or testing the behaviour of any carbon.txt validators/checkers, this domain exists to provide a known domain that should never have a carbon.txt file served from it.</p>
